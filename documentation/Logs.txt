-   I created the routers topology.

-  I changed the topology to have only 1 core router. The project needs to be simple as the name implies.

- I assigned IP addresses and activated IGP on the core. I also enabled LDP on the core routers.

- I assigned IP addresses and activated IGP on the core. I also enabled LDP on the core routers.
- I repeated task above becasue I didnt save the config on the router before powering down.
- I have had to change the core routers because there was not enough NVRAM on the router for the configurations.
- I have restored basic IP connectivity between all interfaces, apart from the networkAutomation device.
- I have enabled MP-BGP and VFR omba_site1 on the core routers.
- What is left is ensuring CE1 and CE2 can communicate.
  Configuring Network automation to log into all routers.

- I have advertised the stastic route into the MP-BGP but I am unable to ping within the MPLS network. 
- I sorted the inability for me to ping within the MPLS network.
  The problem was that the PE had a default route as opposed to a static route.
- I wrote a script to update the CE routers with some management config.
