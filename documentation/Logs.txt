-   I created the routers topology.
-   All routers are currently "Cisco IOU L3 157-3 2018" this is expected to change due to the capability requirement of the core routers and PE routers.

-  I changed the topology to have only 1 core router. The project needs to be simple as the name implies.

- I assigned IP addresses and activated IGP on the core. I also enabled LDP on the core routers.

- I assigned IP addresses and activated IGP on the core. I also enabled LDP on the core routers.
- I repeated task above becasue I didnt save the config on the router before powering down.
- I have had to change the core routers because there was not enough NVRAM on the router for the configurations.
- All CEs' are currently "Cisco IOU L3 157-3 2018", all core routers are "CiscoIOSv15.9(3)M22020-1".
- I have restored basic IP connectivity between all interfaces, apart from the networkAutomation device.
- I have enabled MP-BGP and VFR omba_site1 on the core routers.
- What is left is ensuring CE1 and CE2 can communicate.
